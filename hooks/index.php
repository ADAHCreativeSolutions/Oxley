<h2>Fasten a reputation of quality</h2>
            <p>



Non-crush Hooks & Bars are the first choice for waistband fastening by prestigious garment manufactures and reputed designers as these are designed to withstand pressure at the waist.  Stronger and more durable than buttons and buttonholes. Fixing Hooks & Bars is much simpler compared to buttons and without the inconvenience of needle breakages.
<br /><br />
Fastening the Hooks & Bars is the last operation in sewing trousers and skirts. The non – crush Hooks & Bars are engineered precisely to ensure that the staples glide through the yarn of the waistband without damaging the fibers and close firmly. The “long legs” ensure additional strength. In the event a Hook & Bar fastening does not have these features, it will damage the garment resulting in wastage, as the garment cannot be sold. Using the non – crush Hooks & Bars supplied by OXLEY THREADS Lanka in association with the UK based Thomas Walker always guarantees a quality finish. 
<br /><br />
As well as the traditional nickel fittings, nickel – free fitting are available in steel, non-ferrous brass with a selection of finishes and bronze. The fittings can be solid, embosses and even branded.
