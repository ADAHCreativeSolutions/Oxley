The structured Waistbands we manufacture can be open-ended or closed depending on the style 
of the Trouser. The base fabric enables branding in inserts or designs in keeping with promotions 
or other concepts.<br /><br />
OXLEY THREADS Lanka understands your needs and can include zest in your Trouser with its 
innovative Waistbands which are a class of its own. They are bound to make your Trousers the 
most prestigious ones.
