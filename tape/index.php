        	<h1>ANTI-FRAY TAPE</h1>

<h2>Give a lift to belt loops with Anti-Fray Tape</h2>
            <p>




At the garment assembly stage, an Anti-Fray tape prevent fraying of the loops during the washing and other finishing treatments and eliminates the labour-intensive process of trimming loose and hanging threads from the loops. They become an integral part of the construction, giving the loop a stable, smooth wrinkle-free appearance. 
<br /><br />
Due to their textured surface and unique composition, Anty-Frey tapes can generally be utilized at lower fusing temperatures and or faster line speeds, thereby saving in labour and energy costs.
<br /><br />
These products, manufactured in the USA, are designed to be virtually indestructible when incorporated in belt loops, and will last the life of the garment, through the washing, dry cleaning and pressing processes.
